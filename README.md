🗄️ 5. Firebase Setup Required


✔️ Enable Authentication

Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method

Enable Email/Password

✔️ Add Officer & Staff manually

Because only Users self-register, you must create:

-> Officer account

-> Staff account

from Firebase Authentication → “Add User”.

✔️ Firestore Collections Auto-Generated

These collections are created automatically:

| Collection     | Created By                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `users`        | On registration               |
| `services`     | When Officer creates services |
| `applications` | When Citizen applies          |
| `logs`         | Automatically from logger.js  |

No other manual Firestore documents are required.

🔒 6. Firestore Security Rules

Rules included exactly as per requirement:

-> Citizens can create applications

-> Staff can update status

-> Officer can create/update/delete services

-> Logs writable by all authenticated users

📚 7. Logging

The application includes a complete logging system, capturing every important action performed by any user (Citizen, Staff, Officer).

Every action is logged:

-> Citizen login

-> Citizen registration

-> Apply for service

-> Officer creates service

-> Officer deletes service

-> Staff/Officer updates status

-> Logout

All logs save to:

logs/
<logId>
action:
details:
email:
role:
page:
userId:
timestamp:
